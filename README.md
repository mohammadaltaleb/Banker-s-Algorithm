# Banker-s-Algorithm
This is an implementation of Banker's Algorithm using Java for solving the deadlock problem.

note that (matrices.in, matrices2.in and matrices3.in) are the files containing some input samples to the algorithm, 
the structure of the files is the following:
the first line contains the number of processes followed by the number of resources, after that we have the Allocate matrix,
followed by the Max matrix, and finally, the matrix containing the number of instances for each resource, with lines
separating these matrices.
